# Mandelbrot Set Visualization

Explore the fascinating world of fractals with our Mandelbrot set visualization. You can experiment with different iteration functions (fc) to see how the visualizations change.

## Experimenting with fc

Try modifying the fc function in the code to produce different fractal patterns and visualizations. For example, you can use functions like np.sin, np.cos, or any other mathematical transformations.
