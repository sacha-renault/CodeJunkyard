# CodeJunkyard

Welcome to **CODEJUNKYARD** — a collection of quirky, experimental code snippets and quick algorithms that don’t quite justify a standalone repository. This is where various random ideas, mini-projects, and small experiments go to live. It’s a bit messy, a bit chaotic, but full of creative potential!

## Content

- [Prime Factorization Test Algorithme](./PrimeFactorizer) decompose 𝑛=𝑝×𝑞, where 𝑝 and 𝑞 are prime numbers.

## Structure
Each folder within **CODEJUNKYARD** is a small, self-contained experiment. While not all folders are fully polished, they each hold a unique concept or exploration.
